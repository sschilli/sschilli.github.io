NOTE: For the following steps to work, you be on the Mines network. If you want
      to SSH or use pscp from home, make sure you are connected to the Mines
      VPN network before attempting.

To SSH onto one of the Linux servers on campus through PuTTY, do the following:

    1. Open PuTTY.

    2. In the "Host Name" field, enter:

        <username>@<host_name>

       Where <username> is your Mines username and <hoste_name> is either 
       isengard.mines.edu or imagine.mines.edu.

    3. Make sure the port number is 22 and the connection type is SSH.
       These should already be the default settings.

    4. If you would like to save this session so you can SSH later without
       retyping your username/server, type something in the Saved Sessions
       field (like "Isengard" or "Imagine") and then click Save. You can
       later double click on the session name you gave to automatically
       SSH to the servers.

    5. Click Open.

To copy a file from a Linux server to a local Windows machine using pscp, do
the following FROM YOUR WINDOWS MACHINE:

    1. Open Command Prompt.

    2. Run the command:

        pscp <username>@<host_name>:<path_to_remote_file> <local_destination>

        <username>            - your Mines username
        <host_name>           - the host name of the server you are copying from, 
                                in this case either isengard.mines.edu or 
                                imagine.mines.edu
        <path_to_remote_file> - the path to the file you want to copy from the
                                Linux server. Use the "pwd" command to find the
                                full path of your current working directory 
                                (pscp does not support using the ~ to reference
                                your home directory)
        <local_destination>   - the path where you want to copy the file to your
                                local machine

    3. Enter your password when prompted and hit enter. If successfull, the file
       should now appear on your local machine at the location you specified.

For example, say I am copying the file "test.txt" from my home directory
("/u/ca/dc/sschilli") on the Isengard server ("isengard.mines.edu") to 
the root of my Z drive ("Z:\"). Then I would run the following command:

    pscp sschilli@isengard.mines.edu:/u/ca/dc/sschilli/test.txt Z:\
