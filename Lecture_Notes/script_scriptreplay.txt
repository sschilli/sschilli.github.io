The script and scriptreplay commands are useful for recording a terminal session and
playing it back later. To start the script, run the following command:

    script --timing=<timing_file_name> <typescript_file_name>

For example, the following command would record the typescript in the file week-2.out
and would record the timing information in the file week-2.tm:

    script --timing=week-2.tm week-2.out

To end the script recording, either run the 'exit' command or hit Ctrl-D.

To play back the script using scriptreplay, run the following command:

    scriptreplay --timing <timing_file_name> <typescript_file_name>

Note the lack of the '=' in this command as compared to when running the
script command.

To play back the typescript recorded with the previous command, I would run:

    scriptreplay --timing week-2.tm week-2.out
