= Assignment - Choose an Editor =
=================================

Description
===========
In class, we briefly introduced the vim and emacs editors. Now, you've got to
pick (at least) one to get familiar with.

You must fill out this form     https://goo.gl/forms/oIKxiE1oFKQaSNsw2

It will ask:
    1. Which editor you have chosen for the course
    2. For an explanation of why you chose that editor
    3. For a link to a "cheatsheet" you will use to help
        learn the editor throughout the course

The editor you choose to learn in this course must have all of the following features:
    1. It must be able to run (with all of these features) in a terminal
        (or "console") window, which is to say "non-GUI mode."
    2. It must support syntax highlighting.
    3. It must support search and replace based on regular expressions.

Optionally, the editor you choose may have the following features:
    1. You may be able to "script" or automate the editor.
    2. It may be able to run make (this is a program building command in
        Unix, see man 1 make) and follow compiler formatted error messages.
    3. It may support a visual differencing mode between two files. 

There are at least two Linux editors that support all of these features: vim and Emacs.

If you would like to learn a different editor for the course, find where in its
documentation each of the required features is described and send this
information to the course instructor for review. Your instructor will let you
know if it is acceptable.

Hints
====
---- Experimenting with the Editor Candidates ----
vim and emacs are two very different interfaces for editing files. How can you choose between the two? Try this:
    First, read up a little on both. Wikipedia has relatively good articles on both.

    Next, find online tutorials for both (use a favorite search engine).
    Pick either one to begin with and work through its tutorial for 10 minutes

    At the end of 10 minutes, switch tutorials and work through the other one for 10 minutes
    Repeat this task-switching between tutorials until you begin to lean toward one or the other as your preferred editor
