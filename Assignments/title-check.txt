=================================
=   Assignment - Title Check	=
=================================


Description
===========
In lecture, we have discussed for loops and case statements, as well as reading
multiple tokens from the user with the read command.

Write a script, called TitleCheck.sh that reads a title from the user and
inspects it for appropriate capitalization. For the purposes of this
assignment, here are the capitlization rules:

1. Always capitalize the first word of the title
2. Capitalize any other word except for the nine words:
	a, an, in, out, to, from, for, the, of

Sample runs of your script might look like this:

$ bash TitleCheck.sh
Enter a title:
a bear lives in the woods
'a' should be capitalized.
'bear' should be capitalized.
'lives' should be capitalized.
'woods' should be capitalized.
$ bash TitleCheck.sh
Enter a title:
A bear lives In The Woods
'bear' should be capitalized.
'lives' should be capitalized.
'In' should NOT be capitalized.
'The' should NOT be capitalized.
$ bash TitleCheck.sh
Enter a title:
2014 Is the Year for Sport in Colorado
$ 

Hints
=====
You can echo single quotes around a variable by putting the whole phrase in double quotes, for example: echo "'${term}'"

You can't use {a,an,in,out,...} curly braced patterns in case statements,
instead use | as an "alternation operator":

case "${token}"
  a|an|in|out|... ) 
      echo "Hello little word"
      ;;
esac

The example above is clearly flawed with the elipses, but I think it is enough to jog your memory about | and case.

Do use character range matches! [a-z] and [^A-Z] work in case statements!

The full credit solution is straight-forward algorithmic problem solving --- it
doesn't rely on a Linux trick or specialized Unix knowledge.

Submission
==========
Submit your TitleCheck.sh script for grading on Gradescope.

Rubric [23 points total]
======
[2 pts] Name your script TitleCheck.sh - exact name and case matter!
[5 pts] Uncapitalized first word caught
[5 pts] Miscapitalized words caught
[5 pts] Properly capitalized words and numbers NOT caught
[3 pts] Uses only echo, read, for, and case
[2 pts] One read, for, and case used
[1 pt]  Correct submission

You may use only for loops, case-esac statements, echo and read. You may not
use command redirection (if you already know what this is, which I don't expect
you to).

Full credit may be earned only if you use one read, one for loop and one
case-esac statement.
