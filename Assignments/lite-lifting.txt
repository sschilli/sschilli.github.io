=   Assignment - Lite Lifting   =
=================================


Description
===========
In lecture or reading, we have we have covered pipelines, regular expressions,
grep and sed, and some other text-processing utilities. These are the tried and
true tools of any *nix'rs day to day life. From system administration to
website development and admin, even hard core programmers know how to bend any
problem with the power of these utilities. As a mentor once chided me:
"If you're not using pipelines, you're working too hard."

So let's get to work learning how to work :)

Requirements, Assumptions, and Definitions
==========================================

Write a script, called LiteLifting.sh, it will read the first command line
argument ($1) as a data file name.

LiteLifting.sh will process the file in several different ways based on its
contents.

Your script may not use temporary files to store intermediate results. Instead,
make correct use of pipelines.

Each result should be produced by a single pipeline invocation (see the hint
below for how to store these results into a variable).

You may assume the following about the contents of the file:

	1. The space characters will occur singly in the file. There will not
	   be any portion of the file with two or more spaces in sequence.
	2. The file will contain only alphanumeric characters and punctuation,
	   white space (ASCII code 0x20, 32d), and newline characters.

Definition: a word in the file is any sequence of non-white space characters
bounded on either end by the beginning of the line, the end of the line, or
white space. For instance, consider a file containing:

	Jack had a ball.
	Jill.

The 4th word of the first line is ball. (including the period!); the second
word of the first line is had; and the second word of the second line is
nothing --- it doesn't exist.

Expected Output
===============
Your script should produce output of the following form:

This file has XXX characters in it.
This file has XXX characters not counting newline.
This file has XXX empty lines.
This file contains XXX alphanumeric characters.
The 4th word of the 3rd line of text is /XXX/

The slashes in the last line of output matter.
Notice that every output line ends in a '.' character except for the last line.

In all cases the XXX should be replaced with the appropriate result. If a file does
not contain the specified data then the result should be reported as numerical 0 
or an empty string depending on the context.

ADDITIONALLY: If the file contains the phrase (case sensitive) "Capital Idea" anywhere, even
broken across two lines, then create a version of the input file with all
capital letters ([A-Z]) converted to their lowercase values. Store this new
file alongside old with the appended extension .lc (for lower case). You may
use a multi-line solution for this question.

Hints
=====

This list of hints will hopefully help you understand how to get the values for
XXX in each of the lines of output above. If you're still confused, ask on
Piazza!
1. wc anyone?
2. tr -d before wc ...
3. Expensive carrot? (An empty line has no white space, no visible characters.)
4. Remove newlines with tr, and characters not in 0-9a-zA-Z with sed :)
5. Who says you can't run two seds? Slashes in the output are important (so we
   can see an empty string versus a whitespace).


Just to be clear, for the first part of processing the file, you will have a
separate pipeline for each of these questions. You are not expected to
construct one pipeline for all these answers.

You can set the value of a variable to the output of a pipeline with:
myCount=$(ls -1 |wc -c)
or alternatively (these are back-ticks),
myCount=`ls -1 |wc -c`

The first thing you should do is type up a file to test with! Then tackle these
one at a time --- we've tried to list them in order of complexity, and some
might build on the others.

The 4th word of the 3rd line can be tricky, know that you can specify line
number scope for sed operators (eg: -e 3,4s/Harry/Sally/).

Rubric [48 pts total]
=====================
[2 pts] Name your script LiteLifting.sh
[25 pts, 5 pts each] Correctly determines all output and matches output format above.
[5 pts] Capital Idea logic
[15 pts] No temporary files used, single pipelines for each result. Only 5
	 assignments used (no more than 5 '=' signs in your script). No partial credit.
