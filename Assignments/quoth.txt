=================================

Description
===========
In lecture, we have now discussed processes and their exit codes, which means
we can finally begin using branch logic (if statements) in our scripts.

First, download the quotes.tar.bz2 compressed "tarball" and "unroll" it into a
working directory. The tree should be filled with lots of Star Wars quotes in
appropriately named directories.

Write a script, called Quoth.sh that does the following in a loop:
	1. displays the directories in the current working directory
	2. prompts the user to type a directory name, or QUIT
	3. if the user types QUIT, your script should terminate with an exit code of 0
	4. If the user types a term that is not a quote directory, your script should terminate with an exit code of 7
	5. otherwise, your script should display the directory chosen by the user and the contents of the quote.txt.

A sample run of your script might look like this:

$ bash Quoth.sh
Pick a quote-sayer from:
C3PO
Chewie
Darth
Emperor
Governor
Kenobi
Leia
Obi-Wan
Princess
Quoth.sh
Solo
Vader
... or enter QUIT to exit the script.
Kenobi
Kenobi said...
“Only a master of evil, Darth.”

Pick a quote-sayer from:
C3PO
Chewie
Darth
Emperor
Governor
Kenobi
Leia
Obi-Wan
Princess
Quoth.sh
Solo
Vader
... or enter QUIT to exit the script.
Obi-Wan
Obi-Wan said...
“Mos Eisley spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.”

Pick a quote-sayer from:
C3PO
Chewie
Darth
Emperor
Governor
Kenobi
Leia
Obi-Wan
Princess
Quoth.sh
Solo
Vader
... or enter QUIT to exit the script.
QUIT
$ echo $?
0
$



Another run of your script could look like:

$ bash Quoth.sh
Pick a quote-sayer from:
C3PO
Chewie
Darth
Emperor
Governor
Kenobi
Leia
Obi-Wan
Princess
Quoth.sh
Solo
Vader
... or enter QUIT to exit the script.
Emperor
Emperor said...
“This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of Kenobi, and will soon see the end of the rebellion.”

Pick a quote-sayer from:
C3PO
Chewie
Darth
Emperor
Governor
Kenobi
Leia
Obi-Wan
Princess
Quoth.sh
Solo
Vader
... or enter QUIT to exit the script.
JarJar
$ echo $? 
7
$

Hints
=====
For now you can just use ls -1 to list all of the directories (1 per line) in the current working directory
You will need to use test or [...] inside of an if-then-fi statement in order to terminate on QUIT.
You will need to use ANOTHER test or [...] inside of an if-then-fi statement in order to terminate on an invalid input.
Use cat to display the contents of the appropriate quote.txt.

Submission
==========
Submit your Quoth.sh script for grading on Gradescope.

Rubric [26 pts total]
======
[2 pts] Name your script Quoth.sh (exact name and case matter!)
[1 pt] Outputs "Pick a quote-sayer from:"
[2 pts] Displays all possible quote directories (using ls -1)
[1 pt] Outputs "... or enter QUIT to exit the script."
[6 pts] Displays the quote and the name of the person quoted (if it exists).
	The format should match the examples above e.g:
	PERSON said...
	QUOTE		
[6 pts] Loops until QUIT or incorrect quote directory input
[4 pts] Exit code 0 on QUIT
[3 pts] Exit code 7 on incorrect quote directory input
[1 pt] Correct submission

Hard coding any quotes or directories will result in a low scoring grade. Your
script should work with any set of directories and quote.txt files!
