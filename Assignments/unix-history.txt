=   Assignment - Unix History   =
=================================

Description
===========
In lecture, we have discussed some basic file system navigation commands as
well as how to edit and save a file, and then run it as a bash script. This
assignment will have you write a simple script that demonstrates this
knowledge.

Write a script, called UnixHistory.sh, which will generate an abbrievated
"tree" of the Unix and Unix like operating system ancestry. The data source, as
always, can be found on Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Unix_history.svg

The Unix history begins with a directory named ResearchUnix that has two 
children: BSD and Commercial.

BSD has two children FreeBSD and NextStep, NextStep has a single child
directory: MacOSX.

Commercial has one sub-directory named Solaris

NOTE all the elements mentioned above are directories, created with the mkdir
command. We haven't discussed any files (yet).

Inside of each directory, there should be a regular file called Year (create
this with an echo > command, just as we have in lecture). The Year file holds
the approximate beginning date for each Unix variant. Here is a list of values
for the corresponding Unix variant:

ResearchUnix = 1972
Commercial = 1984
BSD = 1977
Solaris = 1991
FreeBSD = 1993
NextStep = 1988
MacOSX = 2002

A sample run of your script must look like this:

$ bash UnixHistory.sh
$
Which is to say nothing should be printed if all went well.

You can check your work with the find command:

$ find
.
./UnixHistory.sh
./ResearchUnix
./ResearchUnix/BSD
./ResearchUnix/BSD/NextStep
./ResearchUnix/BSD/NextStep/Year
./ResearchUnix/BSD/NextStep/MacOSX
./ResearchUnix/BSD/NextStep/MacOSX/Year
./ResearchUnix/BSD/Year
./ResearchUnix/BSD/FreeBSD
./ResearchUnix/BSD/FreeBSD/Year
./ResearchUnix/Commercial
./ResearchUnix/Commercial/Solaris
./ResearchUnix/Commercial/Solaris/Year
./ResearchUnix/Commercial/Year
./ResearchUnix/Year
$ cat ResearchUnix/BSD/NextStep/Year
1988
$ cat ResearchUnix/Commercial/Solaris/Year
1991
$

You will probably want to check all the Year files to be sure of a high grade...

The order of output from find does not have to exactly match the example above.
But the directory structure under ResearchUnix must be precisely as described.

Details
=======
You may assume that a ResearchUnix directory does not pre-exist along side
UnixHistory.sh. In other words you don't a have to worry about error messages
because directories already exist.

Hints
=====
Recall that you run a script with
$ bash UnixHistory.sh

and you can see what a script is doing on the inside as it runs with the -x option.
$ bash -x UnixHistory.sh

In between testing runs of your script, use
$ rm -r ResearchUnix

to clear out the tree of directories.

Submission
==========
Submit your UnixHistory.sh script for grading on Gradescope here:

Rubric
======
[2 pts] Name your script UnixHistory.sh
[2 pts] No output generated on success.
[21 pts] Directory tree created is correct
[1 pt] Correct submission

The exact name and case of the files/directories are important!
(e.g., UnixHistory.sh is NOT the same as unixhistory.sh and ResearchNix is not the same as ResearchUnix)
